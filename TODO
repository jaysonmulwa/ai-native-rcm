### 4. Phasing of Modules for Launch
===========================
1. Phase 1 (MVP)
- All agents upto the claim submission agent are somewhat less complex, and can be implemented in a single process, even if this process has some human interaction.
- Before the next stage we can handle Denials, Resubmissions,Payment and Reconciliation more manually.
- Integrate with external APIs. 
- UI may be limited to providers only at this stage.


2. Phase 2 (Non-trivial workflow agents)
- We can the implement the set of steps between Denial and Reconcilliation.
- At this stage we have an agentic workflow, but it is still a single process. 
- More rigorous testing is needed. 
- We can create portal for patients and insurance companies at this stage.

3. Phase 3 (Full AI agents)
- We can implement the full AI agents, and have them communicate with each other - Reduce human interaction as far as possible.
- Give Agents decision making power over external APIs and data.
- Advanced Analytics - Agents can also self correct based on analytics they have prepared and learned.
- Phase 2 or Phase 3 would be sufficient to launch.

4. Phase 4 (In-house Models)
- From the data we might have collected, we can fine-tune our models for accuracy (both LLM and traditional ML, NLP and Computer Vision Models)
